        <h1>Overflowing Police Precinct Parking Lots Spark Troubles</h1>

          Community advocates bring attention to another piece in Manhattan's
          mammoth parking puzzle.

        The horns of two fire trucks blared one chilly Manhattan morning as they
        approached a clot of traffic at 100th and Amsterdam on their way to an
        emergency. For minutes, they remained stalled as cars and vans shuffled
        awkwardly to attempt to clear a path.
      </p>
    </div>
    <section id="scrolly-video" class="scrolly-container">

        <div class="step" id="step-first">
          <p>
            At the front of the blockage stood a double-parked delivery vehicle
            that had reduced traffic on the narrow street down to a single lane.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step-second">
          <p>
            This stretch of 100th street is home to both the 24th Police Precint
            and Engine Company 76, Ladder Company 22, and Battalion 11 of the
            FDNY.

            While the block already has several dozen spots dedicated for the
            precinct, officers often park and double park their vehicles on the
            rest of the street as well.
          </p>

        <div class="step" id="step-fourth">

            On this day in particular, several precinct affiliated vehicles were
            blocking the delivery driveway where the truck in question was
            supposed to unload.

            This incident is emblematic of a pattern of complaints from
            residents of the Upper West Side of precinct parking spilling over
            into surrounding streets, leading to frustrating and potentially
            dangerous situations.

        This much was clear from a presentation that Manhattan resident Donald
        Press gave at
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO_Zaww6mj8"
          >the Community Board 7 Transportation Comittee Meeting in March</a
        >.

        These precinct overflows are, of course, just one part of a greater
        problem: parking in New York City is scarce and has only gotten scarcer
        in recent years. The coronavirus pandemic ushered in the widespread
        adoption of dining sheds, a shift to using e-commerce for everything
        from groceries to durable goods, and a fear of public transportation
        that drove historic increases in vehicle registration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Complaints about illegal parking are up across the board as drivers are
        routinely making the decision to block driveways, bike lanes, traffic
        lanes, parked vehicles, fire hydrants, and sidewalks with their trucks,
        cars, vans, and SUVs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many New Yorkers are exasperated by the gridlock and delays these
        infractions cause, and pedestrians and motorists alike are terrified by
        the deadly blindspots at crossings and intersections that these
        illegally parked vehicles create.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the outer boroughs, property owners are paving over their lawns to
        add parking spaces—increasing flood water runoff during heavy storms,
        and obstructing firefighters and EMTs from accessing, and illegally
        cutting sections out of the curb for a new driveway — taking one more
        parking spot off the street and further exacerbating the issue.
