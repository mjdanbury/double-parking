          Community advocates bring attention to another piece in Manhattan's
          mammoth parking puzzle.

        The horns of two fire trucks blared one chilly Manhattan morning as they
        approached a clot of traffic at 100th and Amsterdam on their way to an
        emergency. For minutes, they remained stalled as cars and vans shuffled
        awkwardly to attempt to clear a path.

            At the front of the blockage stood a double-parked delivery vehicle
            that had reduced traffic on the narrow street down to a single lane.

        </div>
        <div class="step" id="step-second">

            This stretch of 100th street is home to both the 24th Police Precint
            and Engine Company 76, Ladder Company 22, and Battalion 11 of the
            FDNY.

            While the block already has several dozen spots dedicated for the
            precinct, officers often park and double park their vehicles on the
            rest of the street as well.

            On this day in particular, several precinct affiliated vehicles were
            blocking the delivery driveway where the truck in question was
            supposed to unload.

            This incident is emblematic of a pattern of complaints from
            residents of the Upper West Side of precinct parking spilling over
            into surrounding streets, leading to frustrating and potentially
            dangerous situations.

        These precinct overflows are, of course, just one part of a greater
        problem: parking in New York City is scarce and has only gotten scarcer
        in recent years.
      </p>
      <p>
        The coronavirus pandemic ushered in the widespread adoption of dining
        sheds, a shift to using e-commerce for everything from groceries to
        durable goods, and a fear of public transportation that drove historic
        increases in vehicle registration.
      </p>
      <p>
        With more vehicles on the street and fewer places to put them,
        non-emergency complaints about vehicles blocking driveways, bike lanes,
        traffic lanes, parked vehicles, fire hydrants, and sidewalks have
        skyrocketed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This makes it all the more tricky to find additional curb space to
        dedicate for precint parking. At
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jO_Zaww6mj8"
          >a Community Board 7 Transportation Comittee Meeting in March</a
        >
        Donald Press, a resident of the Upper West Side who leads the 81st
        Street Block Association, presented a study of the issue he conducted
        which showed that there is a need for about 20-25 extra slots for
        vehicles affiliated with the 20th police precinct alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the prospect of further shrinking the community's stock of street
        parking spaces elicited groans from other attendees who expressed
        discontents about feeling priced out of car ownership due to exorbitant
        garage rates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where everyone agreed was that residents are exasperated by the
        gridlock, delays, and dangers these infractions cause."The deeper
        problem is that it's basically a safety safety safety problem," said
        Press, citing examples of blocked fire hydrants, traffic, and turn lanes
        that he observed.
      </p>
      <p>
        These vehicles obstruct visibility for pedestrians and motorists alike,
        and force vehicles to merge out of blocked lanes at the last second—both
        increase the risk of accidents.
